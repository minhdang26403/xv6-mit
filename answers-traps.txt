1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0-1: Function arguments/return values
a2-7: Function arguments
Register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf
2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?
The call to function f in main is at line 26. The compiler inlines the function f and gets the value 12. 
3. At what address is the function printf located?
The function printf is located at 0x630.
4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
The value of ra is 0x30.
5.
-  The output is HE110 World
- If the RISC-V were instead big-endian, i needs to be set to 0x726c64 to yield the same output. We don't have to change 57616.
6. Some garabage value will be printed after 'y=' since that value printed depends on the value of the register a1.
