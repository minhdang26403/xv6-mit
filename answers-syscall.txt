1. The usertrap() function called syscall()
2. The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7. This value represents SYS_exec, which used as a index to the array mapping syscall numbers to system call.
3. The previous mode of the CPU was usermode.
4. The kernel is panicing at the instruction:
- 80001ff8:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero)
- The register a3 corresponds to the variable num
5. The kernel crash due to load page fault because the virtual address 0 is not mapped to any physical address.
6. The "initcode" binary was running when the kernel paniced. Its process id is 1.
